# In YAML, there are two main styles for handling multi-line strings: folded block style and literal block style.
# Folded block style is denoted by the > character and is used when you want YAML to interpret newlines as spaces and 
# ignore most newlines, except those that are part of an intended paragraph break. 
# output will always be a single line
# but provided space gets ignored
description: >
  This is a folded block style in YAML.
  It allows multiple lines of text, but
  treats each newline as a space. It
  ignores most newlines and only keeps
  those that are part of a paragraph break.

# Literal Block Style (|): Preserves all newlines and spaces exactly as they are, maintaining exact formatting.
# output will be same as the exact way u write
notes: |
  This is a literal block style in YAML.
  
  It preserves all newlines and spaces exactly as they are typed.
  
  This style is useful for maintaining exact formatting, such as code blocks or poetry.

# YAML anchors(&) and alias(*)
# In YAML, anchors and aliases are useful features that allow you to create references to existing data structures
# within the same YAML document.
