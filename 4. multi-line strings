When to Use Each Style

Folded Block Style (>): 
    Use when you want to represent multi-line text as a single paragraph and prefer YAML to handle newlines as spaces.

Literal Block Style (|): 
    Use when you want to preserve exact formatting, such as code blocks, poetry, or any text where the exact layout
and indentation are important.
