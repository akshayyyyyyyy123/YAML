# multi-line strings
# folded block style (>)
description: > 
  This is a folded block style in YAML.
  It allows multiple lines of text, but
  treats each newline as a space. It
  ignores most newlines and only keeps
  those that are part of a paragraph break.

# literal block style
notes: |
  This is a literal block style in YAML.
  
  It preserves all newlines and spaces exactly as they are typed.
  
  This style is useful for maintaining exact formatting, such as code blocks or poetry.
